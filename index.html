                Hello starnger, let me tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Mohammad Harb I'm 28 years old,
                living in Amman, Jordan since I was born. I'm a grandson of a Plaestinian refugee who forced to leave
                Jaffa after the occupation in 1948.
                When it comes to my hobbies, I enjoy camping, travelling, and other adventuring stuff.

                    About my educational history. I'm holding a bachleor's degree in industrial engineering from Jordan
                    university of science and technology.
                    Now I'm part of a scholarship that has been giving by ASAC. After graduating I will have the
                    opportunity to shift career and to be a software developer.

                    I'm an experienced logistician I have mainly one year and a half of experience as logistics
                    assistant in an NGO called Leaders of Tomorrow.
                    In addition to that I started my career since I was 20 years old by establishing an NGO in 2013.
                    I have many other little periods of experiences in different majors and locations.

                My goals in life are many, I don't think one life will be enough to achieve them.
                But mainly I'm focusing on greening the world by fighting global warming and other environmental issues.
                On the other hand I'm also focusing on how to recruit machine learning in a way that make humans life
                satisfying,
                not hell because of the future of machines.
